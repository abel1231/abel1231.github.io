I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), advised by [Prof. Junchi Yan](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn/). Prior to this, I received my bachelor's degree from Shandong University (SDU). My research topics include graph neural networks and generative models. Specifically, I am interested in developing robust learning systems of quantum many-body physics.

I am always open for collaboration opportunities and please feel free to contact me via email: yehuitang@sjtu.edu.cn
